# 👨‍💻 About Me

👋 Hi there, I'm **Fariez Fikhi**, and I’m from the beautiful country of **Malaysia**! Welcome to my GitHub corner, where I'm rebooting my journey in tech. 🚀

🎓 I hold a **Bachelor's in Networking Systems (2018)** and an **MSc in Embedded System Design Engineering (2020)**.

💼 After 6 rewarding years of self-employment outside the tech world, I've decided it's time to dive back into my passion for technology.

💻 **Aspiring Backend Developer** – starting from scratch, eager to build, break, and rebuild everything on my path to mastering backend development.

📚 I'm currently **relearning** everything I left behind, documenting my journey here, one commit at a time.

🌱 **Follow my progress** as I work toward my ultimate goal of becoming a skilled backend developer.
